sheetCalc.js
================================================

sheetCalc.js is a calculation library for javascript that allows you to leave all of your math calculations in excel.

What & Why?
----------------------------------------
Writing Math in javascript is not fun. It is much easier to write & test math expressions in excel. So we convert them.
We use formula.js to convert all of the excel functions to javascript equivalents.

**This library doesn't have the excel to js conversions. This just the run time libraries!!!**



Installation
------------------------------
Add the following to your html file

`<script src="path/sheetCalc.standalone.js"></script>`

This will include the entire library with all dependences. There also also versions without the dependences, checkout the dist folder for more details.


How to use
---------------------------------
Check out the example folder for two examples on how to use this library and for the excel sheet it was generated from.
